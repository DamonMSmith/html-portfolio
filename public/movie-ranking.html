<h1>The Best Movies According to Damon</h1>
<h2>My top movie series of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Star Wars</h3>
<p>I grew up watching this with my Dad.
    Got to see most of the prequel and sequel trilogies in theaters.</p>
<h3>Marvel</h3>
<p>The Avengers are my favorite comic superheroes.
    I like most of the movies up to Infinity War/Endgame,
    although I am unfamiliar with many of the new characters
    introduced afterwards.</p>
<h3>Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p>A really cool epic fantasy between good and evil.
    Many Biblical parallels also. It's amazing how
    Tolkein developed an entire mythology just to write
    a children's story (The Hobbit)!</p>
